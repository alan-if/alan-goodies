# The Alan IF Logo

This folder contains the Alan logo in vector format, reconstructed by Tristano Ajmone using Photoshop shapes. The logo can be losslessly scaled to any size, and then saved to a raster image format according to needs.

- [`Alan-Logo.psd`][Logo PSD] — original Photoshop 7 vector file.
- [`Alan-Logo.tif`][Logo TIFF] — vector logo saved as TIFF.
- [`alan-logo_preview_x500.png`][Logo x500] — Logo raster preview (500x PNG).

![Alan Logo][Logo x500]

> __TIFF NOTE__ — The "`Alan-Logo.tif`" file was created by saving the `.psd` file as TIFF (using ZIP compression) within Photoshop; therefore, its contents are the same as the Photoshop file. It was provided as a convenience for those working with image applications other than Photoshop. Beware that not every application that recognizes the TIFF format supports all the features of this format.

# About the Logo

For a discussion on the origins of the Alan logo, see the _[TRIVIA: The Alan Logo]_ thread on the [Alan IF Yahoo group].

The origins of this image are lost to oblivion in the spiral of time. The image has been used in Alan projects since the '80s, but any referencs to its original author are long forgotten.

We are confident that this image was chosen because it was freely usable, but all attempts to trace back the original clipart collection from which it was taken failed (we tried reverse-image-search engines, vintage clipart collections websites, etc., but to no avail).

If anyone could provide us more information about the origins of this image, and its author, we'd really appreciate it.
