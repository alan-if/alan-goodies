# Introduction

This directory tree is intended as an archive for legacy versions of the various ALAN libraries, to allow users to compile old adventures which depend on them.
Efforts are made to ensure that the archived copies are the latest known version of each library.

Since the goal here is to enable compiling legacy adventures code, the libraries sources might be edited to ensure they can compile with the latest Alan release currently available.
Some of these libraries are quite old, and the Alan language has undergone significant changes in the meantime, some of which _might_ have broken backward compatibility in some cases (although this is rarely the case).

For detailed information on the history and evolution of the various Alan libraries, and their features, consult the [_Alan Libraries_ page] at the [Alan Wiki].
